**PROJECT DESCRIPTION:**
Implemented an image classification project using transfer learning. The project involved the following key steps:

**Data Collection:**

Captured a diverse dataset with a minimum of 100 images per class and at least 3 classes using a smartphone/camera.
Displayed 5 examples from each class to showcase dataset diversity.

**Data Preprocessing:**

Split the collected images into training, validation, and test sets.

**Input Pipeline and Augmentation:**

Developed an efficient input pipeline, incorporating appropriate preprocessing operations.
Integrated data augmentation techniques to enhance model generalization.

**Transfer Learning:**

Fine-tuned a pretrained model of choice on the created dataset.
Reported classification accuracy and provided examples of both correct and incorrect classifications, illustrating model performance.

**Training from Scratch:**

Trained a deep neural network with convolutional layers from scratch on the dataset.
Reported classification accuracy and showcased examples of correct and incorrect classifications, emphasizing the challenges of training deep networks without pretraining.
The project highlighted skills in image data collection, preprocessing, transfer learning, and deep neural network training. The comprehensive approach demonstrated the ability to work with real-world image datasets and implement effective solutions for image classification tasks.
